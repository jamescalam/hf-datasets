       " 'title': 'Vital Energy $VUX has “more than doubled production” but the market hasn’t noticed this yet – it was not yet in financials. Easy cashflow, more growth potential and a future stock multibagger using Q4 2021 numbers financials and 900 BOE/D production + higher oil prices of $100 WTI today',\n",

WTI oil prices have gone up a lot since so Q1 January-March have WTI market prices of somewhere $90 and at the moment we are seeing +$100. Let’s remember that viewing the Q4 financials in the MD&amp;A. **Q1 Financials will be out in a month, end of May**.\\n\\nVital Energy has been able to more than double its production due to 3 new wells as stated in the 5 October 2021 press release (enclosed down below). From 385 barrels in Q2 to 911 barrels daily in Q4. Furthermore, the company owns many more properties, as stated in the MD&amp;A, and has more potential sites for new wells. 4 of the 8 properties are in production, meaning there isn’t a dependency on one location/property. The cost structure is easy as after the Operational Netbacks the company has only limited expenses. Cashflow in Q4 was used to pay back a loan, note 11, of a total 3.8 Mln and make the balance sheet even cleaner.\\n\\nConsidering the high cash flow due to low costs and high oil prices, together with &gt;50% insider ownership, this is not a risk.\\n\\nAs can be seen below, the operational netback in Q4 was $70 dollars with a revenue of $84 per BOE. The average WTI was $77 in Q4. Let us remember that this is October – December and right now oil price is at $100 WTI.\\n\\n\\\\*Please check on Sedar MD&amp;A\\n\\n  \\n\\n**Balance Sheet and Income Statement**\\n\\n**\\\\*Please check on Sedar**\\n\\n**Insider Ownership**\\n\\nManagement owns &gt;50% of the shares so the float is tightly hold \\n\\n[https://www.vitalenergyoil.com/investor/stockqoute.html](https://www.vitalenergyoil.com/investor/stockqoute.html) \\n\\n**Oil Proved Reserves 31 December 2021 – they have more locations for drilling left**\\n\\n**\\\\*Please check on Sedar**\\n\\n**Valuation**\\n\\nIf you use the IWC (Microcap ETF) P/E ratio for the full year 2022 profit per share – expected based on production, oil price and cost structure - the stock is worth a lot more. That is for a company with a good balance sheet and a clear cashflow, not something you find in most microcaps as with this ETF. Therefore, using a P/E of 10-15 sounds very reasonable to me. This leaves out the potential growth of new oil wells. [https://stockanalysis.com/etf/iwc/](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/iwc/) \\n\\nConsidering the production only started to increase since August, and oil prices are now at $100 WTI, I see a completely different picture for FY 2022.\\n\\n**Oil Industry**\\n\\nI’m positive towards oil as the world still needs oil. From 2011-2019 the world energy consumption increased by 10% and oil consumption source increased at the same rate according to this source.
